# Introduction

## What this is 

This is a short, vibe check community survey of the XOXO community. In early October, Andy McMillan and Andy Baio (sometimes collectively referred to as “the Andys”) announced that because the festival had ended this year, they would be closing down the XOXO Slack community that has been going since the beginning of the festival. 

There was a lot of discussion in the slack and some folks suggested we might want to do a survey to discuss next directions. In consultation with Pete Modica-Soloway, Josh Millard and Nora Ryan, I (Beth) put together this survey to start the conversation. 

This report is meant to summarize the findings and to pull out key themes so as to start the conversation. 

## Lower your expectations

I have done a quick organization of the comments for each question into themes as a way to share the information that came from the survey. In each theme, I add a bunch of quotes that describe what I'm seeing.

The qualitative coding/tagging (meaning grouping responses into themes) is rough, imperfect and it was done very quickly. I wanted the community have something fast more than I wanted to perfect it. 

That means there might be a theme you see that I didn’t create, or something that fits with multiple themes. You might disagree with how I named the groupings, or you might think a quote in a theme is wrong altogether. All of this is great.  

If you think something is was placed in the wrong spot, or that I missed a theme or that it’s named wrong, you are probably right. You're invited to let us know, point out mistakes or to do another pass at it on your own or read the raw data in the dataset if you'd prefer that.

The goal for this for paper was to create an easier way to start a community discussion, not a final "in stone" explanation of what everyone was saying. By reflecting what I saw/read in the data, I’m starting the process of summarizing to get our conversation going. 

Please, don’t worry about my feelings and go ahead and converse.

It's also LONG, so I understand that it might feel overwhelming. I made it long because I feel strongly that listening to the many voices of other people involves letting their words be at the center. So I include a lot (a lot) of quotes. 

This may be overwhelming. I am sorry about that. I’ve done my best to summarize so you don’t have to read it all unless you want to. I encourage you to skip sections if you don't want to read something, or just go straight to the comments for the Andy's and commence weeping. Or not. You do you.

There are likely a lot of typos. If you feel strongly about this and want to contribute, you are warmly invited to copy edit what I’ve written. However, in this kind of research, I don’t edit what people write in their response to the survey. This means that if there are typos in what people wrote, there are typos in how it is shown here. This is not meant to shame anyone, but rather to preserve what people say and how they say it. I don’t presume I know better how to say what someone else is saying than they do.

## Gift 

This work is a gift freely given to a community that has given me so so much. 

It is also something I’ve been able to do because I am between projects and I have free time right now as a freelance researcher. 
Which means, I am looking for work. This is a small section of the kind of things I can do research-wise. Just think of how much more I could do if I was paid!  

If you want to talk to me about research projects for money or want to drop a few bucks my way, I’m always up for it: beth@duckles.com
