# Values of the Community 

The question we asked was: “If you were to briefly summarize the core values of the XOXO Slack Community as it exists now, what would they be? 

Many folks responded with a string of words separated by commas, so I pulled those apart, counted them and collapsed where appropriate (e.g. creative, creativity and creations became creativity). Others wrote a phrase or a sentence and those are interspersed in the discussion where they added to the themes. 

The most popular words folks used were: (approximate number in parentheses): 
	•	Creativity (16)
	•	Empathy (16)
	•	Inclusivity (13)
	•	Openness (12)
	•	Curiosity (8)
	•	Kindness (7)
	•	Thoughtful (6) 
	•	Caring (5) 
	•	Community (5)

	•	A like-minded community conscientious of etiquette, while encouraging curiosity and discovery without competing for popularity or ostracizing members.
