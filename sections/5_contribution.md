## Barriers to Contribution 

We asked participants specifically about barriers they had to using or contributing to the Astropy project and `astropy` software. These barriers ranged from technical to community and more broadly systemic barriers to how sofware development is credited in academic communities. 

Some areas to explore changes in how Astropy works could be around how first  contributions take place, and what can be done to remove barriers to the first contribution made in the community. 

####   Git is Intimidating

Looking at the version control software Git, some of the responses talked about 
how Git itself can be a barrier as it can be intimidating and require some skills that not all beginners have. 

>  Making a pull request is intimidating, since I usually don\'t have code that is modular or generalizable enough to become a new feature

>   yes, contributing a PR to astropy requires a fairly advanced level of git and github knowledge. this has improved some over the years, but one still has to be aware of what \"rebase\" and \"squash\" mean.
       
>    see previous answer about being more welcoming of non-expert contributions to github issues and code.

#### Complexity and Technical Skill

Many responses centered around the sheer complexity of the Astropy software stack, and how that itself was a barrier to entry. Others noted that tools and procedures to make developer's lives better are 
often not always better for the newcomer. 

> Astropy is huge. The project is very daunting to find a place to contribute.

> Contributing code to Astropy takes a relatively high degree oftechnical skill. That makes it more accessible to people who have the free time or resources to acquire that skill.

> I haven\'t tried very hard, but it is sometimes staggering how much complexity goes into contributing to Astropy. I gather that the main dev team is aware of this and is thoughtful about improving accessibility.

>  Hard to know who is responsible for what parts of the codebase and which parts are \"ok\" to touch vs \"need to be left like that\" for\... reasons.
        
>    We could lower the bar for contributing code by being careful of the barriers that the Python linter \"ruff\" has introduced.


#### Knowing Where to Start

A few responses talked about not knowing where to start and how to bring their skills and expertise into the community. It is clear these resondents would like to find ways to contribute, but might need some support in order to be able to do so. 

> Knowing where to start contributing!

> Lately (last \<3 years), it\'s been difficult to keep up with
        deprecations & CI updates. I\'m constantly being asked to learn
        new software practices that are not relevant for the software
        tools themselves. This is fine, I just need help keeping up.

> I'm a rubbish coder!

####  Value of the Work to One's Career

A few responses focused on how their own jobs or careers did not value contribution to open soruce. This is a common problem in many academic open source domains, and is worth discussing as a community to better understand how the reward structures in Astronomy may not be aligned with work that needs to be done as a broader community. 

>   It\'s not counted as valuable work.

>   My biggest barrier has been the expectation that the longevity of my career as an astronomer would be at risk if I contributed to astropy as frequently as I wanted. Few things in life are zero-sum, but there\'s no flexibility on the finite 24 hours in a day. I was cautious about spending time on work in the astropy ecosystem that wouldn\'t produce a first author paper.

#### Community

Community members seemed to be looking for more interactive ways to get-to-know others in the community. Some felt like discussions they had been privy to moved to some other platform they weren't aware of at a certain point in time. Others mentioned that being optically focused, they felt a excluded as a radio astronomer. 

>  As mentioned before the main barrier that I found was to find the community discussion in places where I participate. I tend to avoid privative platforms and I could see how participation in, for example, the email list faded with time. At some point I did not know if people moved somewhere else or something elsewas happening.

>  Sometimes its hard to line up terminology from the radio
astronomy community with astropy terminology. It feels very
focused on optical astronomy.

>  I am not been able to get involved with the astropy project due to lack of interaction with the community. If there\'s any wayto interact with the community, I believe I and many more people will be able to contribute

####   Documentation

Documentation was observed to be not very accessible to one respondent. Some 
work to gather user feedback from documentation users might help to develop some
guidelines and work sprints on improving documentation in ways that it can become 
more useful to newcomers. 

>  Minimal (and somewhat outdated) documentation for creating an Astropy affiliated package; the assumption seemed to be that people doing this would already be very familiar with the Astropy package architecture and procedures, and so no explanation of what anything in the (default) package was for seemed to exist. Consequently, I gave up my attempt to create an affiliated package.


#### No problems

A few responses have said that their first contributions went very well, and their interactions with maintainters was "lovely". 

>  No, my first contribution was last year and I\'ve done a few more since that. Loved all the interactions with the maintainers, they\'re lovely.

>  No, to the contrary: the friendly response to my first
issues/PRs is a major reason I got hooked.
