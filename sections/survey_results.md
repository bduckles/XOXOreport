# Survey Results 

## Community Composition

Our first research question was look at the compostion of the Astropy Community. In the survey, we asked questions to get a better sense of the role, age, involvement level, geographic location and how comfortable respondents felt giving feedback to Astropy leadership. 

Generally we find that the majority of respondents are professional astronomers in early to mid career. We see a long term commitment among respondents to Astropy with 40% being involved with Astropy between 5-10 years. Respondents were primarily in North America.  

### Professional Astronomers

The survey team was interested to know what percentage of respondents work professionally in the field of astronomy. Not surprisingly, an overwhelming majority of respondents, 93% (n=89) make a living in a field that is related to astronomy. 

Those who do not work in Astronomy are a student, a freelance software developer, a retiree, an academic, a space industry professional, a healthcare professional and a planetary defense worker. Many of these are astronomy / science adjacent, even if not identified by the respondent as an "astronomy" jobs.

### Age Distribution 

Strong academic software communities have a mix of early, mid and late career participation. In this survey we found that the folks who responded to the survey were distributed strongly towards early to mid career representation, but with some participation in very early and late career age cohorts.

### Involvement in Astropy

The length of involvement shows over half (57) of respondents have been involved for five years or more, with 40 having been involved for less than five years. For a community looking to constantly re-charge and grow its longterm utility and appeal it is important to continue to be inviting new community members. Continuing to fill the pipeline with participants who have not been involved for very long can help to build long-term participation.

### Location and Time Zones

To get a sense of geographic distribution of participants we asked both for physical location and time zone. A majority of 69% of respondents are located in one of the five North American major Time Zones (Eastern, Central, Mountain, Pacific, Arizona).

Next in order was European timezones with a collective 20% across Europe. The rest of the time zones (~10%) are spread across other parts of the world, mostly in Asia. From the timezone data, it appears that the community could target growth in Asian timzeones, as there is a large global population there.

### Feedback to Leadership

We were interested to know what percentage of survey respondents had engaged with Astropy leadership in the past. From our survey response, about 33% of community members report that they have given feedback to the leadership of Astropy. It is also worth noting that 12 respondents (~10%) reported they had at one time held a leadership position in Astropy.


## Participation in Astropy 

Our second research question asked "How do community members participate in Astropy?" We wanted to know how people used Astropy resources and community, what they used it for beyond just the software products. 

This section is divided into two subsections a) positive attributes of Astropy and b) data on how people reported engaging with Astropy. 

### Positive Attributes of Astropy 

We asked respondents in a free response survey question to tell us what they liked about Astropy and several themes emerged. 

The words that we saw respondents repeatedly use to describe Astropy were: friendly, collaborative, welcoming, inclusive, useful, helpful, open, responsive, knowledgeable, thoughtful, responsive & supportive.

Generally people found Astropy to find high quality, well documented software which is useful for their work. They like how open, friendly and welcoming the community is, mentioning how supportive the feedback is and that leadership is strong and that there is a focus on learning. 

#### High Quality Software

Respondents said that Astropy creates high quality, well-documented software as one of the reasons they like the organization. 

> Amazing, high quality, well tested software. Much of it is built by early career researchers who deserve better rewards!

> It generates high-quality astronomy software.

> Supportive, careful, high quality code.

> They write fantastic code.

 > They are inclusive, thoughtful, and help develop and steward a truly wonderful (useful, user-friendly, powerful, versatile) software product.

#### Useful

Respondents said that they used Astropy software in their work and described it as practical, reliable and useful. Several respodnents mention that it is a core part of the work they do. 

> Commitment to standardizing useful software

>  It is a dedicated community that has created a very strong, reliable software base! Makes it so easy to develop new tools on which my research group relies extensively.

> I like how practical the package is, it\'s all but central to all my work now.

> I use Astropy, so I like the community that maintains it.

> Very welcoming, nice group of people that are focused on making a practical tool for astronomy


#### Openness

Another theme was the importance of the software being open. This was often paired with a comment about kindness or the helpfulness of the people in the organization.  

> Super open, collaborative, helpful folks. It attracts the best and kindest astronomers in the field.

> I like open source software, have a background in Astronomy and look forward to contributing more after retiring at the end of the month

> It's open source and most of the people are helpful and have similar kinds of coding/software problems as me


#### Friendly

The word "friendly" was used often in describing Astropy largely in terms of the friendliness of the community. 

> Friendly and shared interests

> Always helpful and friendly.

> It's a friendly, inclusive community that \[creates\] useful, pragmatic software development standards.

#### Welcoming Community

Survey respondents talked about the inclusive and welcoming nature of the community when describing what they like about Astropy. In particular, people commented on the way that the community makes it possible for beginners or people who are new to be included. 

>  It\'s a community that is very supportive and welcoming of people who are starting out as users/contributors

> I appreciate how inclusive it is. It has a great group of contributors.

> It\'s a lot of people who have similar use cases and very different solutions. A large group of people

> Since I joined... I was welcomed into the community, and worked my way up to leadership positions that align with my values.


#### Constructive Feedback and Support

Another theme was the sense that the community offeres helpful and constructive responses to questions as well as feedback and support that is helpful and friendly. 

>  Friendly response to first contributors. Generally a real attempt to be constructive in PR review (and keep a sense of humor, especially pllim; thanks!!)

> On the FB group I've been floored by the way everyone is respectful to questioners, even if they approach with little prior knowledge. I am so, so grateful for everyone involved in astropy development - it has absolutely transformed my work from IDL days.

> Most of my interactions with the broader Astropy community have been supportive, even including code reviews.

> You can ask questions and people are prompt to give feedback.

>  I think Astropy pundits are inclined to help out with user questions.


#### Leadership

Respondents described the leadership of Astropy as transparent and well organized. 

> I think the decisions made by the community and those in leadership positions are done in a way that is as transparent as is reasonable.

> thought has been put into the collaboration and contribution guidelines

> It\'s active and continues to put in effort to improve engagement and its structure as an organization.


#### Other
Additional comments responding to what people liked about Astropy are:  

> Interesting discussions involving celestial mechanics.

> Supportive, great resources for students


### How to Engage with Astropy
We asked a series of questions designed to gather data on the specific ways that respondents engaged with Astropy, these are summarized below. Specifically we looked at respondent's engagement with GitHub and software development, documentation and educational modules and how they used Astropy in their work.  

#### GitHub and Software Development

We wanted to get a sense of how respondents had personally engaged with GitHub. We asked if respondents had opened an issue on GitHub, 51% reported not having opened an issue, 49% had either in the past year or earlier. 

We also asked if respondents had entered comments on an existing issue. 65% had not commented on an already open issue, with 25% having responded to an issue in the last year, and about 10% having done so greater than a year ago. 

When asked if respondents had contributed code to Astropy, 67% have not, while 33% had, 20% in the past year, and 13% greater than a year ago. 

When asked if respondents contribute to other software that is dependent upon Astropy, 55% of respondents reported having done so in the past year, with a further 6% having done so more than a year ago. Leaving 39% of respondents who had not. 

When asked about contributing to or maintaining affilitated packages, 24% had done so, 19% in the past year, and 5% more than a year ago. Most respondents, 76% report they have never done so. 


#### Documentation and Educational Modules 

With the exception of two respondents, every respondent had used the Astropy documentation in the past. Most, (n=90) had used the documentation in the last year. 

Similarly we asked about the use of Astropy tutorials that are available through the https://learn.astropy.org website. 51 respondents had used these in the last year, and 29 had more than a year ago. Only 13 had never used the Astropy tutorials.

We asked about the use of Astropy developed materials in teaching activities, and 31 respondents had in the last year, and 18 more than a year ago. 43 respondents had not used the tutorials in teaching situations.

We also asked if respondents had ever attended an in-person Astropy workshop, or other in person event. 68% had never attended an in-person Astropy event, while 19% had more than a year ago, and 13% in the last year. 

#### Astropy at Work 

When asked if Astropy software is used in the course of people's work, 91 had in the last year, 2 more than a year ago and only 3 respondents had not. 



## Communication Channels 

We wanted to get a better understanding of the way that people used Astropy's communication channels. To do this we asked both specific questions as well as open ended questions. Both are summarized here.  

### Facebook, Slack, Discourse Enagagement

When we asked people directly if they were part of the Python Users's in Astronomy Facebook group, a group with 7,300 members. From our survey respondents, 57% were not members, 24% had used the group in the past year, and 19% had more than a year ago. 

We similarly asked about Slack community participation, 58% had not used Slack at all, 34% had in the past year, and 8% had more than a year ago.

When asked about the Open Astronomy Discourse, 80% had not used it, the remaining 20% had in the past, 13% in the past year, and 7% more than a year ago. 

### Benefits of Online Forums
We asked respondents what the benefits were for engaging with online forums and how they used them. Respondents told us that they used the forums to get  answers to questions, to learn about technical updates as well as to avoid challenges with updates or as an alternative to opening a Github issue. Some discussed forums as a place to see the transparency of the development process or to understand the use cases for the software. Some also commented that they used the forums for learning materials. Others responded that they did not know that Astropy online forums existed. 

Below we've summarized the themes from their responses with representative quotes. 

#### Getting Answers 

Respondents talked about one of the benefits of the online forums is that they are a place to give or receive specific, tailored answers to questions. Folks called it an "informal help desk" and a place to get expert advice, help with problems, as well as a place to network and communicate with the community. 

> Ability to get expert answers to very astro-specific questions that are hard to ask on more general python forums

> Discourse is where we would like users to post their questions so they are retrievable by search engines.

> a friendly place to engage with a quick response time

> I don\'t benefit from them. The only reason I joined is to help answer questions about the bit I maintain in my affiliated package.

> I get to communicate with the community who use Astropy and might have different solutions to problems that I have as a user. Usually, Astropy\'s devs are too busy to answer questions but having online forums allows me to unstick myself through the community.

> I learn new stuff and occasionally get to help other people with their problems.


> I use it very effectively as an online informal helpdesk

> It\'s a great place to get advice on astronomy/Astropy specific problems/issues. Similar to StackExchange but focused.

> Networking, helping people, solving my problems.

> Questions and answers on best practices, how-to\'s, confusing errors



Specifically some folks turned to the Slack to get these answers and saw it as the place to communicate with developers. 

> I really appreciate the Slack group to ask questions of the developers and users on capabilities and how to implement astropy in my work.

> Slack has proven to be the most effective way to reach some developers. Unfortunately not 100% of devs use Slack frequently, so some folks are still hard to reach.

> Slack is a quick way to ask questions of, and exchange news with, project members.

> Slack: communication with other developers. Discourse: communication with Bob developer users


#### Technical Updates 

Many respondents appreciate the ability to keep abreast of what is going on in the community. From seeing bug reports to workshop planning and more in-depth conversations. Some community members said they wanted to avoid things breaking due to updates or bug fixes and they turned to the online forums for that knowledge.

It is clear that survey respondents see online forums as a place to keep updated on what is happening with Astropy. A lot of community building and networking take place in these channels.

> Seeing latest updates on Astropy package.

> Advertising new features in releases

> Facebook group posts a lot of useful information

> Keeping informed about development, get a feeling of the ways that the people use astropy, learn about other people problems...

> Recent announcements, bug reports, feature freezes, etc.

> Looking out for events, jobs or opportunities to join or contribute to a software project in astronomy.

>  Any new issues with using astropy on new hardware such as the macintosh m1, m2, etc.


Again, respondents saw Slack as the place to keep up with news, announcements, project news and updates. 

> Slack is very useful for keeping up with the project, and we use it for workshop planning.

> Slack is a good way to communicate about workshops and project news. 

> For Slack, it mostly helps to keep track of announcements.

#### Alternative to Github Issues

Some specifically mentioned that they use these forums as an alternative to Github issues. 

> I use slack for conversations that don\'t fit into github issues.

> Quick feedback on questions or discussions that don\'t warrant a Github issue


#### Transparency of Technical Development

Some also commented that being in these forums allowed them to see how the developer ecosystem worked. 

>   A view into the vibrant developer ecosystem of this indispensable software package

>   Examples of the kinds of questions others are asking
   


#### Use Cases
Some also saw the forums as a good place to look for use cases and ways that people are using their code to solve problems. In essence, this becomes a place for developers to see real life use cases of the technology. 

>   Use case examples

>   For discourse, it can help find similar use cases or issues (in addition to Github).

>   I get to see how others are using their code to solve problems, a great learning opportunity.

>   I keep myself updated about the use cases and issues from multiple users.

>   New usage ideas

#### Learning Via Community
Some said that online forums were a place where they learned to use Astropy and found resources they needed. 

>   I learnt how to use Astropy

>   Pointers to resources


#### Not Aware
Several of the people that were surveyed did not know that the online forums existed or did not use the forums. This will also be reflected int he next question around improving online forums. 

>   I am not involved and/or not aware they existed

>   I can not use slack due to fees, not a Facebook member

>   I currently don\'t use them

>   I do not use these, in particular, I am not a facebook member

>   I don\'t use these; I have too many other forums to keep up with

>   N/A - I have no interest in more distractions, so am not part of online forums

> I haven\'t looked at Discourse or Facebook very often.


### Improvements to Online Forums

When asked what survey respondents thought would improve online forums, we saw several ways that these spaces might be improved. 

Respondents commented that the communities seem fragmented, that there is a challenge of needing spaces for users and also for developers, they also commented on specific issues with Discourse, Slack, Facebook and other sites. We also heard that folks were not aware of some of the online forums, that they want more resources for beginners/new users and searchability of the forums is a priority. 

#### Fragmentation of Forums
Respondents mentioned that there is a fragmentation in the Astropy online communities and indcated a need to make clearer what each forum is for and where information is located.  

> I would like to know where is the community discussion now. Fragmentation is a problem but I do not know how to solve it.

> I would get more developers looking at Discourse and I would make notifications more apparent. Slack is pretty good as-is but I would try to move users to Discourse so it could be more like a Stack Overflow site.

 > Focus on supporting one as a primary community hub and make it clear who it\'s for; often I feel like Astropy online discussions are only for serious developers/contributors of record, not users stumbling through trying to do a coordinate crossmatch for the first time. I vote Slack!

 >    More general information posted. General updates, etc.

#### Forums for Users vs. Developers

Specifically, the fragmentation was between user forums and developer forums and some folks had suggestions on how to mitigate the different needs of each community. 

>    it would be better to distill forums into just two: one for developers, one for users. the current slack fits the bill for developers and is very active. i would recommend choosing between discourse and facebook rather than supporting both.

>   would like to have a kind of \"users forum\" rather than be included in the development discussions

>   More engagement from developers and users on Discourse

>   it\'s good to be able to contribute to the discussion, but a lot of discussion is also too technical for me

####  Discourse

Some folks had specific thoughts about the use of Discourse and indicated that it has less people who are active on the forum. 

> Discourse could, in principle, be a nice resource, but is under-utilized; it mostly seems to be used as a low-traffic tech support forum, which is a missed opportunity.

 >  Need more users on discourse to teach critical mass

>  More engagement from developers and users on Discourse

>  I would try to steer user questions towards Discourse and I would set up better notifications for Discourse. Discourse is not active and the interface does not invite engagement.

####  Slack
Opinions about Slack varied. Some indicated that they'd prefer not using it, while others had specific opinions on 

> It would be nice to replace Slack by a more open system, but it\'s not clear that would really get an appropriate head of steam.

> I would like to see more general discussion in slack. Everything seems to be very specific

> Please avoid using Slack

> I think Slack is fine as is.

> Nnobody from WCS team participates on Slack.


#### Facebook, Bluesky and Twitter

Folks who responded had thoughts about Facebook as well as Bluesky/Twitter. 

> Facebook is an exclusionary walled-garden; there shouldn\'t be any official presence there.

>  I am not on Facebook.

>   Move to bluesky and off of Twitter/x

#### I Didn't Know

Similar to responses to the previous question, some folks indicated that they did not know about all the forums that are available to Astropy members and indicated they'd like to have information on how to join. 

>   I was only aware of the Facebook group and not of the other platforms. Making the various ways of discussing topics known would be ideal.

>   I didn\'t know there was a slack or discourse! Would love to know how to join those channels.

>   I didn\'t even know about Slack, so I need to check that out. 

####  New Users

Respondents said that information about how to join or become involved for new folks would be helpful. 

>  Clear directions pinned for new users to get involved.

>   I think some tutorials or resources for people that may want to get more involved in contributing to astropy project but don\'t have a background in astronomy or astrophysics but may be coming from a related field, e.g. physics, computer science etc. 

#### Searchability

Some folks also mentioned that a priority was to make sure that the online forums were searchable. 

>   I would find stackoverflow-style searchable questions + ranked answers more useful than a linear stream of forum discussions.

>    Make it more searchable

>    The issue with FB is that the search features for past questions aren\'t great.

> Slack is fine the way it is and I am happy with that except it is not useful as a way to search for code question answers.


#### Other

Finally we heard a few additional comments: 
>   Use open platforms please.

>   It would be nice to see closer ties with the AstroJulia community.


## Improving Participation 


### Change about Astropy

We asked respondents what they would change about Astropy, leaving the question open-ended so as to enable comments on technical, social, or other issues faced by community members. Newcomer issues were a major theme, with several respondents mentioning the desire to have easier entry points for using or contributing to astropy. Other themes included respondents seeking improvements to the affiliated package and PR processes, expressing desired support for using Astropy in educational settings, and suggesting revisions to community priorities. 

#### Easier Contributions

Respondents described wanting wanting to make contributions to the community easier. Some also described not knowing how to make a contribution more learning opportunities for newcomers or returning
members and 

> A \"one stop shop\" or \"single pager\" for new people t learn how astropy works and how to get involved. Ideas such as the first projects tags on github should continue.

> I think the bar for new contributors is still very high. I think ways to make it easier to contribute, either to the core astropy package or to affiliated packages, would be helpful. Some more explanation on new code infrastructure pieces like ruff, black, and type annotations would be helpful

> I would like to be able to engage again but I do not know where.

> I would like to contribute code or documentation, but I find it hard to understand what issues are open, a priority, and something I know how to contribute to.

> Make it easier to contribute

#### Development of Affiliated Packages

The Astropy community seems to value affiliated packages both for their utility in practice and the experience of developing affiliated packages alongside the community's experts. Still, respondents had several ideas for improvements in affiliated package development and standardization. 

> I most want to see us introduce an incubator pathway for developing new tools. This serves a dual-purpose of allowing for nimble creation of new software, as well as providing a platform for drawing-in folks from the \"new astropy contributor\" phase to the long-term contributor phase.

> We see that hack days can kick-start really useful tools on timescales of days, and full-time positions (like those belonging to folks at STScI) can construct sustainable tools on timescales of months or more. GSoC can do something intermediate, but those positions are focused more on mentorship. Of course, there are plenty tasks to accomplish on the to-do list already. But I worry, for example, that small grants to \"explore units compatibility with dask\" might be \*too\* small. Working a few percent over a year might be less efficient than six focused months at a much higher level.

> I know we don\'t have money to do this right now, but what if we competitively award grants to post-PhD folks to seed projects that could become affiliated packages? We could provide check-ins with liaisons from astropy who work to preserve/enforce interoperability within the ecosystem. And we\'d help foster the folks at upper end of the user-to-developer pipeline.

#### Standards for Affiliated Packages

Several respondents were interested in improved and more clear documentation and 
standards. 

> Better documentation for associated / affiliated projects.

> Clearer documentation (including tutorials) about how to convert an existing package to an Astropy Affiliated package (without assuming the person who wants to do this is already an Astropy developer).

> More standardization and quality control

#### Support for Non-Astropy Software

There was a theme around getting support for how to use astropy in more complex environments with other software, as well as exploring new paradigms for commputing
within the community.

>  expanded emphasis on astronomical software in general. python is a good solution for many use cases, but not always the optimal one.

>  I'd like to see some cross package tutorials, particularly with widely used iterative techniques such as MCMC. I know how to use these types of packages separately, but integrating them correctly is something I struggle with. Particularly with Astropy methods such as the ones in cosmology. The tutorials section is great already, it would just be helpful to include some iterating techniques and how
to successfully use them with astropy methods.

>  More focus on evolving code to support new paradigms for
 high-performance computing, like JAX.


#### Code Quality and Maintenance

There were some concerns about quality and purity of code coming before some
more practical concerns. Also an observation of a need for more people with the role of "maintainter".
It is clear that commnity members value code quality and stability of code that comes from 
the community. 

> I perceive the community to be snobbish about code quality / purity, while at the same time undermining itself with things like cosmetic changes to API options that breaks my code whenever I upgrade to the latest version.

> More maintainers, to lighten the load (astropy core package, but probably true for other parts too)

> Not too much, really. It would be nice to have more highly-qualified developers with free time to dedicate to open issues.



#### Happy with the current state or personal challenges

Several respondents were comfortable with the way the community is at the moment.
While some thought there would be some ways to improve involvement and kindness.

> I know it\'s not helpful, but I really like the community right now and I don\'t have any ideas at the moment about how it could be improved.

> I like things the way they are.

> I would like to find time to be more involved.

> Replace Astronomers with kinder and more normal people.

#### More Support for Education

One respondent expressed a need for a more full curriculum shared by the Astropy community
that can help teach astronomy programming with more structure.

> Having more tutorials and perhaps a full curriculum available for instructors to use/adapt for classes would help greatly. Astronomy programming is still taught somewhat ad-hoc at least at my institution.

#### Support for Early Career Astronomers

Similar to the education support, there was a clear expression by some respondents of a need for more formal ways of learning about and getting credit for high-quality
software developemnt.

> I hope we are teaching young astronomers very early how to build, maintain, and contribute code. It was very hard for me to learn at a later career stage.

> Much of it is built by early career researchers who deserve better rewards! But that\'s not so much a problem in the Astropy community but rather in academia as a whole.


#### Networking and Jobs 
One respondent was interested in seeing more career development opportunities
or project collaboration opportunites as part of the community. 

> One thing I would like to suggest is showing related job or project
    opportunities

#### Faster Response Times 

One respondent was concerned about how some GitHub Issues linger unaddressed by the community. 

> Better responses to issues raised (often just ignored, even if they are acknowledged issues)

#### PR Process

There was feedback about the challenges of submitting PRs and the number of comments and changes requested for PRs. 

> easier PRs (often excessive commenting and requested changes by dev, making the experience very onerous)



## Barriers to Contribution 

We asked participants specifically about barriers they had to using or contributing to the Astropy project and `astropy` software. These barriers ranged from technical to community and more broadly systemic barriers to how sofware development is credited in academic communities. 

Some areas to explore changes in how Astropy works could be around how first  contributions take place, and what can be done to remove barriers to the first contribution made in the community. 

####   Git is Intimidating

Looking at the version control software Git, some of the responses talked about 
how Git itself can be a barrier as it can be intimidating and require some skills that not all beginners have. 

>  Making a pull request is intimidating, since I usually don\'t have code that is modular or generalizable enough to become a new feature

>   yes, contributing a PR to astropy requires a fairly advanced level of git and github knowledge. this has improved some over the years, but one still has to be aware of what \"rebase\" and \"squash\" mean.
       
>    see previous answer about being more welcoming of non-expert contributions to github issues and code.

#### Complexity and Technical Skill

Many responses centered around the sheer complexity of the Astropy software stack, and how that itself was a barrier to entry. Others noted that tools and procedures to make developer's lives better are 
often not always better for the newcomer. 

> Astropy is huge. The project is very daunting to find a place to contribute.

> Contributing code to Astropy takes a relatively high degree oftechnical skill. That makes it more accessible to people who have the free time or resources to acquire that skill.

> I haven\'t tried very hard, but it is sometimes staggering how much complexity goes into contributing to Astropy. I gather that the main dev team is aware of this and is thoughtful about improving accessibility.

>  Hard to know who is responsible for what parts of the codebase and which parts are \"ok\" to touch vs \"need to be left like that\" for\... reasons.
        
>    We could lower the bar for contributing code by being careful of the barriers that the Python linter \"ruff\" has introduced.


#### Knowing Where to Start

A few responses talked about not knowing where to start and how to bring their skills and expertise into the community. It is clear these resondents would like to find ways to contribute, but might need some support in order to be able to do so. 

> Knowing where to start contributing!

> Lately (last \<3 years), it\'s been difficult to keep up with
        deprecations & CI updates. I\'m constantly being asked to learn
        new software practices that are not relevant for the software
        tools themselves. This is fine, I just need help keeping up.

> I'm a rubbish coder!

####  Value of the Work to One's Career

A few responses focused on how their own jobs or careers did not value contribution to open soruce. This is a common problem in many academic open source domains, and is worth discussing as a community to better understand how the reward structures in Astronomy may not be aligned with work that needs to be done as a broader community. 

>   It\'s not counted as valuable work.

>   My biggest barrier has been the expectation that the longevity of my career as an astronomer would be at risk if I contributed to astropy as frequently as I wanted. Few things in life are zero-sum, but there\'s no flexibility on the finite 24 hours in a day. I was cautious about spending time on work in the astropy ecosystem that wouldn\'t produce a first author paper.

#### Community

Community members seemed to be looking for more interactive ways to get-to-know others in the community. Some felt like discussions they had been privy to moved to some other platform they weren't aware of at a certain point in time. Others mentioned that being optically focused, they felt a excluded as a radio astronomer. 

>  As mentioned before the main barrier that I found was to find the community discussion in places where I participate. I tend to avoid privative platforms and I could see how participation in, for example, the email list faded with time. At some point I did not know if people moved somewhere else or something elsewas happening.

>  Sometimes its hard to line up terminology from the radio
astronomy community with astropy terminology. It feels very
focused on optical astronomy.

>  I am not been able to get involved with the astropy project due to lack of interaction with the community. If there\'s any wayto interact with the community, I believe I and many more people will be able to contribute

####   Documentation

Documentation was observed to be not very accessible to one respondent. Some 
work to gather user feedback from documentation users might help to develop some
guidelines and work sprints on improving documentation in ways that it can become 
more useful to newcomers. 

>  Minimal (and somewhat outdated) documentation for creating an Astropy affiliated package; the assumption seemed to be that people doing this would already be very familiar with the Astropy package architecture and procedures, and so no explanation of what anything in the (default) package was for seemed to exist. Consequently, I gave up my attempt to create an affiliated package.


#### No problems

A few responses have said that their first contributions went very well, and their interactions with maintainters was "lovely". 

>  No, my first contribution was last year and I\'ve done a few more since that. Loved all the interactions with the maintainers, they\'re lovely.

>  No, to the contrary: the friendly response to my first
issues/PRs is a major reason I got hooked.
